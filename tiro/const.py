CHUNKSIZE = 64*1024
# the response streams are sent back in chunks.

POOLSIZE = 128
# tiro uses requests's connection pool mechanism and tornado's thread pool mechanism.
# a bigger poolsize will improve concurrency but will consume more RAM.

COMPRESS_THRESHOLD = 32*1024
# tiro uses gzip to compress large Finale request data.
# increase the threshold for better upload speed. decrease the threshold for shorter TTFB.

# for mode 1, tiro will redirect websites in GFWList or with connection problems to Finale server.
